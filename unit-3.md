### Transition-Based Dependency Parser Using Deep Learning (Easy Explanation)

A **Transition-Based Dependency Parser** is a method to find the grammatical structure of a sentence, such as which words are subjects, objects, or verbs. In deep learning, this process is automated using neural networks. Here's a simple explanation of how it works:

---

### **Concept**
1. **Sentence as Input**: The sentence is split into words (tokens), like:  
   `"John hit the ball" → ["John", "hit", "the", "ball"]`.

2. **Stack and Buffer**:
   - **Stack**: Keeps track of words already processed.  
   - **Buffer**: Holds the words yet to be processed.

3. **Actions**: 
   The parser uses three main actions:
   - **Shift**: Move a word from the buffer to the stack.
   - **Reduce**: Combine two words on the stack (if they have a dependency).
   - **Arc**: Connect two words (like a subject and verb).

4. **Neural Network**: Deep learning is used to predict the next action based on the stack, buffer, and existing dependencies.

### **Steps with Example**
For the sentence **"John hit the ball"**:
1. **Start**:
   - Stack: `[]`
   - Buffer: `["John", "hit", "the", "ball"]`

2. **Shift**: Move "John" to the stack.
   - Stack: `["John"]`
   - Buffer: `["hit", "the", "ball"]`

3. **Shift**: Move "hit" to the stack.
   - Stack: `["John", "hit"]`
   - Buffer: `["the", "ball"]`

4. **Arc**: Connect "John" (subject) to "hit" (verb).
   - Dependency: `John → hit`

5. **Shift**: Move "the" to the stack.
   - Stack: `["hit", "the"]`
   - Buffer: `["ball"]`

6. **Shift**: Move "ball" to the stack.
   - Stack: `["hit", "the", "ball"]`
   - Buffer: `[]`

7. **Arc**: Connect "ball" (object) to "hit" (verb).
   - Dependency: `hit → ball`

### **Deep Learning Role**
- A neural network is trained on large datasets of sentences and their dependencies.
- It learns to predict which action (shift, reduce, arc) to take at each step by looking at patterns in the stack, buffer, and previous actions.

### **Why Use Deep Learning?**
1. **Accuracy**: Neural networks can handle complex sentences better than traditional rules.
2. **Flexibility**: They can learn from multiple languages and adapt.
3. **Efficiency**: They automate the process, requiring less manual intervention.
